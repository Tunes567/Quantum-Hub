# Migration from Flask to Next.js

## Why We Migrated

We migrated from Flask to Next.js for the following reasons:

1. **Better Vercel Integration**: Vercel has first-class support for Next.js, making deployment more reliable and efficient.

2. **Deployment Issues**: We encountered persistent 500 Internal Server Errors and `FUNCTION_INVOCATION_FAILED` errors when deploying the Flask application on Vercel.

3. **Simplified Architecture**: Next.js provides a unified frontend and API solution, eliminating the need for separate frontend and backend services.

4. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Next.js offers hot module reloading, TypeScript support, and other modern development features out of the box.

5. **Performance Benefits**: Next.js provides server-side rendering, static site generation, and client-side rendering options for optimal performance.

## What Changed

### Key Changes:

- **Frontend**: Migrated from Flask templates to React components
- **API**: Converted Flask routes to Next.js API routes
- **Database**: No changes to the database layer
- **Authentication**: Will use Next.js-compatible authentication

### File Structure:

- `/pages`: Contains all React pages and components
- `/pages/api`: Contains all API routes
- `/public`: Static assets
- `/styles`: CSS styles

## Previous Deployment Issues

The Flask application encountered persistent issues when deploying to Vercel:

1. **500 Internal Server Errors**: Even after simplifying the application, we continued to receive 500 errors.

2. **Function Invocation Failed**: The serverless function execution was failing for reasons that were difficult to diagnose.

3. **Environment Configuration**: Difficulties with Python dependencies and environment variables in the serverless environment.

4. **Timeouts**: Potential issues with function timeouts and cold starts.

## Moving Forward

For future development:

1. We can still leverage the existing database and backend logic, but it will be accessed through Next.js API routes.

2. The SMS sending functionality can be reimplemented as API endpoints that connect to the same SMS services.

3. User authentication will be implemented using Next.js compatible solutions like NextAuth.js.
